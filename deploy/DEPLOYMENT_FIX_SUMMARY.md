# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Root Cause: No Systemd Service**
- **Problem**: Gunicorn was running manually but not as a systemd service
- **Impact**: Application would stop when SSH session ended or VM restarted
- **Fix**: Created proper systemd service with auto-restart capabilities

### 2. **Missing Health Monitoring**
- **Problem**: No way to detect if Gunicorn crashed
- **Impact**: Application could be down without anyone knowing
- **Fix**: Added health check script that runs every 5 minutes via cron

### 3. **Improper Startup Script Execution**
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow didn't ensure startup script ran properly
- **Impact**: Deployment was inconsistent
- **Fix**: Improved startup script with better error handling and systemd integration

### 4. **No Logging Infrastructure**
- **Problem**: No centralized logging for debugging
- **Impact**: Hard to troubleshoot issues
- **Fix**: Added proper log files and journald integration

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Systemd Service Configuration
```bash
# Service is now managed by systemd
sudo systemctl status tropical-cloud-detection
sudo systemctl enable tropical-cloud-detection  # Auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl restart tropical-cloud-detection  # Manual restart
```

### ✅ Health Monitoring
```bash
# Health check runs every 5 minutes
sudo crontab -l  # View cron jobs
/opt/tropical-cloud-detection/health_check.sh  # Manual health check
```

### ✅ Improved Logging
```bash
# View service logs
sudo journalctl -u tropical-cloud-detection -f
sudo journalctl -u tropical-cloud-detection --no-pager

# View application logs
tail -f /opt/tropical-cloud-detection/logs/django.log
tail -f /opt/tropical-cloud-detection/logs/django-error.log
```

### ✅ Auto-Restart Capability
- Service automatically restarts if it crashes
- Health check restarts service if it's not responding
- Service starts automatically when VM boots

## Current Status

✅ **Application is running**: http://35.247.130.75:8080  
✅ **Systemd service active**: `tropical-cloud-detection.service`  
✅ **Health monitoring active**: Cron job every 5 minutes  
✅ **Auto-restart enabled**: Service will restart on crashes  
✅ **Logging configured**: Both systemd and application logs  

## Commands for Monitoring

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status tropical-cloud-detection

# View real-time logs
sudo journalctl -u tropical-cloud-detection -f

# Check if application is responding
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# View health check logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/cron

# Restart service if needed
sudo systemctl restart tropical-cloud-detection
```

## Future Improvements

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The improved workflow will create proper systemd services automatically
2. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Could add Prometheus/Grafana for better monitoring
3. **Load Balancing**: Could add multiple instances behind a load balancer
4. **Database**: Could migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Improved deployment workflow
- `deploy/fix_current_deployment.sh` - Manual fix script
- `deploy/DEPLOYMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

The application is now **production-ready** with proper service management and monitoring!
